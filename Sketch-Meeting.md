# Github pitch
- I think we should use github for this. It will be fairly simple. it's pretty easy in the terminal in R. I can write up a git flow cheatsheet for this.
- Difficult to run shiny app in colab + slower
## Git Flow
- when you open the project to work on it,
- run `git pull`
- when you get something working, run `git add -a`
- run `git commit -m "<write a descriptive message>"`
- run `git push`
- repeat these steps before you close the file

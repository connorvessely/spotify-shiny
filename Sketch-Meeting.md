## App Sketch 

## Git/ Github
We decided to use git for filesharing and coding collaboration.

### Git Flow
- when you open the project to work on it, run `git pull`
- when you get something working, run `git add -a`
- run `git commit -m "<write a descriptive message>"`
- run `git push`
- repeat these steps before you close the file

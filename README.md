## Git Flow
![an image showing how to open a terminal with Windows 11](Assets/open-terminal.png)
- open a terminal in the project folder, called spotify-shiny
- on Windows, you can do this by opening the spotify-shiny folder in the file explorer, right click, and select `Open in Terminal`, as shown above
- when you open the project to work on it, run `git pull`  
- when you get something working, run `git add .`
- run `git commit -m "<write a descriptive message i.e. Add danceability plot>"`  
- run `git push`  
- repeat these steps before you close the file
- use `git status` to see what files are committed and see other git messages 
- if you follow these steps every time, there should hopefully be no problems
